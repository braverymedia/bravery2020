          <p class="is-large">Your institutional website shouldn't be a loss-leader for enrollment. It should be the
            hardest working, most profitable part of your marketing budget. Every penny spent on a new website, digital
            viewbook, or
            virtual tour should be accounted for. Why pay $150,000 or more for a website redesign when you have no idea
            if that website will perform the way you expect it to?</p>

          <h2>The Best Value in Higher Ed Digital</h2>
          <p>We're proud to provide outstanding return on
            investment, but even more proud that our human-centric, research-based approach to digital strategy
            and design organically surpasses the goals our clients set. How did we generate more than 5700&times; ROI
            for National University? We cared. Bravery recognizes that every website user is a real person with real
            emotion and baggage. We build in affordances, make our strategy inclusive, and extend dignity to the real
            human beings that interact with our work.</p>
          <p>Placing personal value on your audience members translates into unbelievable financial and brand value for
            your institution. It's a matter of hospitality. It's a matter of respect. And it really is that simple.</p>
